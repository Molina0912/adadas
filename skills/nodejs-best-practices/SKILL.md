# Node.js Best Practices

> Principles and decision-making for Node.js development in 2025.
> **Learn to THINK, not memorize code patterns.**

## When to Use

Use this skill when making Node.js architecture decisions, choosing frameworks, designing async patterns, or applying security and deployment best practices.

---

## How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **decision-making principles**, not fixed code to copy.

- ASK user for preferences when unclear
- Choose framework/pattern based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to same solution every time

---

## 1. Framework Selection (2025)

### Decision Tree

```
What are you building?
│
├── Edge/Serverless (Cloudflare, Vercel)
│   └── Hono (zero-dependency, ultra-fast cold starts)
│
├── High Performance API
│   └── Fastify (2-3x faster than Express)
│
├── Enterprise/Team familiarity
│   └── NestJS (structured, DI, decorators)
│
├── Legacy/Stable/Maximum ecosystem
│   └── Express (mature, most middleware)
│
└── Full-stack with frontend
    └── Next.js API Routes or tRPC
```

### Runtime Considerations

| Runtime | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Node.js** | General purpose, largest ecosystem |
| **Bun** | Performance, built-in bundler |
| **Deno** | Security-first, built-in TypeScript |

---

## 2. Architecture Principles

### Layered Structure

```
Request Flow:
│
├── Controller/Route Layer
│   ├── Handles HTTP specifics
│   ├── Input validation at boundary
│   └── Calls service layer
│
├── Service Layer
│   ├── Business logic
│   ├── Framework-agnostic
│   └── Calls repository layer
│
└── Repository Layer
    ├── Data access only
    ├── Database queries
    └── ORM interactions
```

---

## 3. Error Handling Principles

### Status Code Selection

| Situation | Status | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Bad input | 400 | Client sent invalid data |
| No auth | 401 | Missing or invalid credentials |
| No permission | 403 | Valid auth, but not allowed |
| Not found | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |
| Server error | 500 | Our fault, log everything |

---

## 4. Async Patterns

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `async/await` | Sequential async operations |
| `Promise.all` | Parallel independent operations |
| `Promise.allSettled` | Parallel where some can fail |

### Event Loop Awareness

```
I/O-bound (async helps):
├── Database queries
├── HTTP requests
└── Network operations

CPU-bound (async doesn't help):
├── Crypto operations
├── Image processing
└── → Use worker threads
```

---

## 5. Security Principles

### Security Checklist

- [ ] **Input validation**: All inputs validated
- [ ] **Parameterized queries**: No string concatenation for SQL
- [ ] **Password hashing**: bcrypt or argon2
- [ ] **JWT verification**: Always verify signature and expiry
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Protect from abuse
- [ ] **Security headers**: Helmet.js
- [ ] **Secrets**: Environment variables only

---

## 6. Testing Principles

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Unit** | Business logic | node:test, Vitest |
| **Integration** | API endpoints | Supertest |
| **E2E** | Full flows | Playwright |

---

## 7. Decision Checklist

Before implementing:

- [ ] **Asked user about stack preference?**
- [ ] **Chosen framework for THIS context?** (not just default)
- [ ] **Considered deployment target?**
- [ ] **Planned error handling strategy?**
- [ ] **Identified validation points?**
- [ ] **Considered security requirements?**

> **Remember**: Node.js best practices are about decision-making, not memorizing patterns.
